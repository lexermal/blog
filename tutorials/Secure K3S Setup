# Setup K3s with secure connection to clients via WireGuard

Hello, this tutorial will show how to easily set up a K3s cluster.


## Situation
Let's assume you have multiple servers that are all available over the internet. This could be because you are testing out multiple hosting services or simply have multiple servers you want to connect to one cluster to keep the administration effort small.

This tutorial will show how to configure a master server and one worker node. The steps shown can be repeated for an infinitive large about of worker nodes. When the number is overgrown 10, it is recommended to look out for an automated way to set up hosts.

Therefore, let's assume the hosts have the following config:

**Master Host**
* Name: master-host
* Public IP: 1.1.1.1
* It is reachable from the internet.
* OS: Debian or Ubuntu like OS

**Worker Host**
* Name: worker-1
* Public IP: 2.2.2.2
* It is reachable from the internet.
* OS: Debian or Ubuntu like OS


## Set up the Master host
1. Enter sudo mode ```sudo su```
2. Make sure the system is up-to-date with ```apt-get update```
3. Install WireGuard with ```apt-get install wireguard -y```
4. Generate a public and private key for WireGuard

   ```wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey```
5. Go to the directory of WireGuard ```cd /etc/wireguard```
6. Print out the private and public keys

   ```echo "private key: $(cat privatekey)" && echo "public key: $(cat publickey)"```
7. Copy the keys somewhere, you will need them in a minute.

Insert the following lines in /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

    [Interface]
    # This is the IP adress on which this host is reachable over the wireguard tunnels.
    Address = 10.1.1.1/24

    # Specifies the UDP port used for the VPN clients to connect to the wireguard host. This port must be reachable from the internet.
    ListenPort = 51871

    # Here the private key of /etc/wireguard/privatekey needs to be set
    PrivateKey = yJQjFR18...7UiL60g=

    # This line saves and updates this config file when a new VPN peer is added.
    SaveConfig = true

Now bring up the WireGuard interface with ```wg-quick up wg0```.

### Setup K3s
Download the WireGuard install script with ```wget https://get.k3s.io -O k3s-install.sh```

Install WireGuard with ```sh k3s-install.sh --advertise-address 10.1.1.1 --flannel-iface=wg0```
This sets it up with advertising its interface to connect to the WireGuard interface with the IP we configured for the master host.

Now you can check if everything worked by displaying the nodes

```kubectl get nodes```
